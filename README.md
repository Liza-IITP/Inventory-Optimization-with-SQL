# ðŸ“¦ Inventory Optimization with SQL

## ðŸ›’ Problem Statement

Urban Retail Co., a mid-sized retail chain with 5,000+ SKUs, faces major inventory inefficiencies:
- Stockouts of fast-moving items
- Overstocking of slow-moving products
- Poor real-time SKU visibility
- Manual, reactive inventory decisions

Despite having access to sales, product, and warehouse data, the company lacks data-driven inventory management.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

Design a SQL-based inventory monitoring system to:
- Track stock levels across warehouses and stores
- Detect low inventory using reorder thresholds
- Analyze turnover and SKU performance
- Forecast demand and reduce excess inventory

## ðŸ§© Key Deliverables

- âœ… Advanced SQL queries for:
  - Stock level calculation
  - Low inventory alerts
  - Reorder point estimation
  - Inventory turnover KPIs
- âœ… Normalized database schema + ERD
- âœ… Performance-optimized queries (indexes, joins, window functions)
- âœ… Analytical summaries with business insights

## ðŸ“Š Business Impact

- ðŸ“‰ Reduce stockouts and overstock
- ðŸ’° Lower holding costs
- ðŸ“ˆ Improve supply chain efficiency
- ðŸ˜Š Enhance customer satisfaction
