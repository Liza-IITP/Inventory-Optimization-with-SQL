# ðŸ“¦ Inventory Optimization with SQL

## ðŸ›’ Problem Statement

Urban Retail Co., a mid-sized retail chain with 5,000+ SKUs, faces major inventory inefficiencies:
- Stockouts of fast-moving items
- Overstocking of slow-moving products
- Poor real-time SKU visibility
- Manual, reactive inventory decisions

Despite having access to sales, product, and warehouse data, the company lacks data-driven inventory management.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

Design a SQL-based inventory monitoring system to:
- Track stock levels across warehouses and stores
- Detect low inventory using reorder thresholds
- Analyze turnover and SKU performance
- Forecast demand and reduce excess inventory

> A smart inventory system starts with smarter queries.
